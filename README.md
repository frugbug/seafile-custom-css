My custom CSS for Seafile

### Why is there a website?
Because if I simply put the file from `raw.githubusercontent.com` into Seafile's custom CSS field, it won't work. Github serves all text files with a MIME type of `text/plain` to prevent abusing abusing their service as a CDN, which is a shame, because that would be really cool. So in order to have the CSS file hosted here (and also have it work), it needs to be part of a Github pages site.
